                        India Gate
                        India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial War Graves Commission (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The architect was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of New Delhi. The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria. Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known, continued until 1931, the year of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India.
                        <br>
                        Lutyens declined to incorporate pointed arches or other Asian motifs in his design but strove instead for classical simplicity. The result is often described as similar in appearance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. On the rooftop above the archway is a broad shallow domed bowl that was intended to be filled with flaming oil on ceremonial occasions. No fires have been set on the rooftop in recent years, but four eternal flames are now sheltered at the base of the structure. The flames demarcate the Amar Jawan Jyoti, a small monument that has served as India’s tomb of the unknown soldier since 1971.

It is one of the famous tourist sites in India.[1] The ancient name of the place is Thirukadalmallai.

                        Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group of royal monuments, many carved out of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), the giant open-air rock relief the Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva.[1][3] The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.[4]<a href="https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=Awr1QGuIYu5ju9gTY8e7HAx.;_ylu=Y29sbwNzZzMEcG9zAzIEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Ny/RV=2/RE=1676595977/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fMamallapuram/RK=2/RS=je_rsA5ChxS9vjRx_70dSrx6Brw-"><br><br><button class="bn5">Read More about Mahabalipuram</button></a></h2></td>

                        The Brihadishvara temple is just as much a symbol of power and wealth as it is a shrine to Shiva. Inscriptions—made on the walls detailing the ruler’s lavish gifts to the temple—are evidence enough of the wealth of the Chola dynasty. They list jewels, gold, silver, attendants, and 400 female dancers who were brides of Shiva. When the temple was constructed, it was the largest in India. Moving away from the small-scale design of earlier temples, it set the standard for a new age of grandiose design. Its design also marks a shift toward larger and more ornate gateways, or gopuras, until they eventually overshadowed even the main shrine.
                        
                        At a height of more than 200 feet (60 m), the main shrine of the temple is the highest pyramidal shrine tower in south India. Legend says its domed cupola—which weighs more than 80 tons—was transported to the structure’s apex via a gently sloping ramp that was 4 miles (6.5 km) long. Inside the main shrine sits a lingam, or votary object, that is 13 feet (4 m) tall and that represents Shiva. Murals depicting Rajaraja I decorate the walls and are thought to be the most extant important examples of Chola painting, even though much of these have been partially obscured by a later Nayakas mural. A shrine and a pavilion intended to house a huge stone Nandi—Shiva’s bull—were also added during the Nayakas period in the 17th century.
